# MONOSCRIPT VS Code Extension

Welcome to the official VS Code extension for the MONOSCRIPT programming language!

This is the very first version of the extension, providing basic support for MONOSCRIPT in Visual Studio Code.

## Current Features

*   Basic syntax highlighting for `.ms` files.
*   Custom rules for `Enter` and `Backspace` to manage indentations with the `|` character.
*   An icon theme for `.ms` files.
*   A collection of useful snippets to speed up common coding patterns. You can trigger them by typing their prefix (e.g., `msfunc`, `if`, `const`) and pressing `Tab` or `Enter`. Available snippets include:
    *   Function definitions (`msfunc`, `main`, `sfunc`, `pfunc`, `efunc`)
    *   Constant declarations (`const`)
    *   Control flow statements (`if`, `ifelse`)
    *   Return and echo statements (`return`, `echo`)

## Future Plans

We are actively working on improving this extension. Our immediate plans include:

*   **Language Server Protocol (LSP) Integration**: To provide advanced features such as autocompletion, go to definition, find references, error diagnostics, and much more.
*   **Improved "Smart" Indentation**: Further refinement of the logic for code indentation and formatting during input.
*   More comprehensive and accurate syntax highlighting.
